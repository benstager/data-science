2. Do exercise 1 for the set {z: 11m zl < 7T/2}.
3. Discuss the mapping properties of cos z and sin z.
4. Discuss the mapping properties of z· and zl/n for n 2. (Hint: use polar coordinates. )
5. Find the fixed points of a dilation, a translation and the inversion on Coo.
6. Evaluate the following cross ratios: (a) (7 + i, I, 0, 00) (b) (2, 1-i, 1, 1 + i) (c)(O, 1, i, -I)(d)(i-l, 00, l+i, 0).
7. If Tz = az+b / cz+d —find Z2' Z3' Z4 (m terms of a, b, c, d) such that Tz = (z, cz+d / az+b).
