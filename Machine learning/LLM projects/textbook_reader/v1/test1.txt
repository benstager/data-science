 
1. Find the sixth roots of unity. 
2. (a) Calculate the square roots of i; (b) Calculate the cube roots of i; (c) Calculate the square roots of -3 + 3i.
3. Show that if a and b are primitive nth and mth roots of unity, respectively, then ab is a kth root of unity for some integer k; explain what can be said if a and b are nonprimitive roots of unity.
4. Use the binomial equation and compare the real and imaginary parts of each side of de Moivre's formula to obtain formulas for cos nO and sin nO. 
5. Show that 1 +z+ ... +z"-= 0 for z = cis -lor an integer n 2. 
6. Show that eiO = cis t is a group homomorphism of the additive group IR onto the multiplicative group T = {z: Izl = I}. 
7. If z E C and 0 for every positive integer n, show that z is a non-negative real number.
